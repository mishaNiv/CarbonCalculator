# CarbonCalculator
This project calculates the carbon footprint of a single car or flight trip using accurately researched data and a proven algorithm for calculating carbon footprints. The program asks the user a few questions to determine the nature of the trip, including whether the user travelled in a car or flight, the model of the car/type of seat on the flight, the miles travelled/starting and ending airports, and whether it was a round trip. Using this user-inputed informations, as well as known data, the program will output the carbon output of the user's trip in terms of metric tons. 

To run this program, it is recommended that you use the Apache Netbeans IDE, though similar IDEs may also work.
